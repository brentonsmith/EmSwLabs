# Embedded Software Example Code for the K70

This is some example code written to utilize the K70 architecture.

It was written with a partner for a university assignment, and I have chosen to upload it because I remember my frustration at the lack of sample code when I was developing this.

Hopefully other developers out there in the field, or just getting started with embedded systems, will find this of great value.
